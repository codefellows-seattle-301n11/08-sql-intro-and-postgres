**Author**: Ashley Breunich and Mike Kermes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Working with PostgreSQL, create a database and store blog articles to be worked with in it. This app should be able to create, read, update, and delete articles from the database. Once data is received from the database present it appropriately.

## Getting Started
Install and include any dependancies or packages needed (listed below).
Setup and connect to SQL/Database, install and include middleware.
Review and comment where prompted to in the starter code.

## Architecture
The application is built out using multiple tools. On top of JavaScript, the libraries and packages needed for this are: jQuery, express.js, Handlebars.js, and postgreSQL. While working through the fullstack enviroment being created, having an understanding of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) is needed.
