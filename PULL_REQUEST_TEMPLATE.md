#### Single-line Summary
**J, Harry and ED pair programmed on this project, most of our computers were having difficulties getting everything set up and working most of the week, the project took about four days.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. We started by getting our computers uploaded with the necessary programming.
  2. We then started by going through the user stories and the CRUD testing, programming each part one at a time.
  3. We finished up by doing the reviews, comments, and readme files.
